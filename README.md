[Library Application User Guide](#library-application-user-guide)

## 1. Introduction
The library application is a tool that allows users to browse, search, and borrow books from the library. Through this application, users can also manage their loans, check loan history, and view return dates. Administrators have the ability to add new books, manage the catalog, and oversee borrowing activities.

## 2. Registration and Login
To use the application, users must register. The registration process involves providing a password and username.

After registration, users can log in using the provided username and password.

## 3. Book Search
The application allows users to search for books based on various criteria, such as title, author, genre, or year of publication. The search bar is located on the main page of the application and enables quick access to desired books.

After finding a book, users can view details such as book description, availability, and location in the library.

## 4. Borrowing Books
To borrow a book, users must be logged in. After finding a book that is available, they can click the "Borrow" button. If the book is unavailable, users can place a reservation, and the application will notify them when the book becomes available for pickup.

After borrowing, the user's profile will show the loan date and the return date for the borrowed book.

## 5. Managing Loans
In the "My Loans" section, users can view their current and past loans. They can check which books are currently borrowed, when they need to be returned, and extend the return date if the book has not been reserved by another user.

If a book is not returned on time, the application sends reminders and charges overdue fees according to the library's policy.

## 6. Administrator Functions
Administrators have access to advanced features such as managing the book catalog, adding new items, editing book details, and overseeing loans.

They can also manage users, assign different privileges, and generate reports on library activity, such as the number of loans, most borrowed books, and users' overdue items.

## 7. Reserving Books
If a user wants to borrow a book that is currently checked out by another user, they can use the reservation feature. Once the book is returned by the previous user, the person who made the reservation will be notified when the book is ready for pickup.

## 8. Conclusion
The library application streamlines the process of borrowing and managing books in the library. Users can easily browse the catalog, borrow, and reserve books, while administrators have full control over the system's operation.

Regular updates and an intuitive interface ensure that the application is fast and convenient to use.


## Vision of the Library Application

The vision of this library application is to implement it within traditional library systems that rely on physical library cards. The goal is to modernize and optimize the library management process, making it easier for both users and librarians to handle book borrowing, reservations, and catalog management. 

By integrating with existing library infrastructure, this application aims to:
- Streamline the borrowing process, reducing wait times and administrative workload.
- Provide users with real-time access to book availability, reservations, and due dates.
- Offer librarians advanced tools for catalog management and loan tracking, minimizing human errors.
- Enhance user experience through an intuitive interface, enabling library patrons to efficiently browse and manage their book loans from any device.
- Provide detailed reporting and analytics on book borrowing trends and user behavior, helping libraries to make informed decisions on book acquisitions and resource allocation.

This system offers a seamless upgrade to libraries that wish to modernize without abandoning the use of traditional library cards, preserving the essence of the classic library experience while improving efficiency and user satisfaction.
